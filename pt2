<h1> The Origin of Kimchi </h1>

Kimchi originated more than 3,000 years ago, and it developed through the Goryeo Dynasty. However, it significantly transformed and influenced Korea, especially in the Joseon Dynasty. During this period, Korea was struggling with a huge agricultural problem. Food was becoming scarce in the winter. So, Koreans relied on salt to preserve various kinds of food. Originally, kimchi was made from radishes as it was a common and local product, but over many years, it has evolved into the usage of new vegetables.</p>
